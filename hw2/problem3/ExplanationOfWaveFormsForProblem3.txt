We can see from my wave form for problem 3c that my simulation is correct.

Initially the req and ack signals are set to 0, and the state is  set to 000.
We then see a proper cycle through the system with correct timings, moving the state 000 -> 001 -> 010 -> 011 -> 000

Then we see the ack go to 1 while in state 000, which is illegal. This sends the machine to state 100, which is the error state. The error state remains until the reset signal is called.

Then we see the machine sent to state 001, and hold the state, as it should do while no inputs change.
Finally we see the machine transition to state 010, and then to the error state. Showing the error state is reachable from any state if the inputs are triggered incorrectly.

This shows that my model is accurate and functions as the specifications describes.
